# GDAv1Forwarder — convenience wrapper for GeneralDistributionAgreementV1
# Allows direct interaction with GDA functions without manually routing through
# the Host's batchCall / forwardBatchCall. Operates as a trusted forwarder,
# preserving msg.sender via EIP-2771.
#
# Each forwarder call is a standalone transaction — forwarder calls cannot be
# combined in a Host.batchCall. To batch multiple operations atomically,
# use Host.batchCall with the raw GDA agreement (operationType 201).
# See Superfluid.rich-abi.yaml for batch operation details.
# Tradeoff: forwarder calls produce human-readable descriptions in wallets
# (e.g. "createPool(token, admin, config)"), while Host.batchCall shows
# encoded tuples that are difficult for users to verify.
#
# This contract has no events or custom errors — all events/errors propagate
# from the underlying GDA, Pool, and Host contracts.
